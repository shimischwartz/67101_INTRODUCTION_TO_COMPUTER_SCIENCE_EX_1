I discussed the exercise with: menachm oren, gedalya hekelman, netanel twito.

I took information from the following  web-pages:
https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html?highlight=power#module-math
https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%99%D7%97%D7%A1_%D7%94%D7%96%D7%94%D7%91

In this targil I wrote a code that draws a flower bed and a code
that makes basic mathematical calculations
